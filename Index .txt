      The border properties allow you to specify how the border of the box 
representing an element should look. There are three properties of a border you 
can change:
 The border-color specifies the color of a border.
 The border-style specifies whether a border should be solid, dashed line, 
double line, or one of the other possible values.
 The border-width specifies the width of a border.
Now, we will see how to use these properties with examples.
